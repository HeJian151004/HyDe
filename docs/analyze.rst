Analyzing Data with HyDe
========================

**This page is still in the works. Sorry!**

HyDe can be used to analyze data in a couple different ways. Analyses can be run from the command line
using either the ``run_hyde.py`` script or the ``hyde_cpp`` executable itself. Analyses can also be run
from within Python by importng the ``phyde`` module, reading in your sequence data and map file, and
running hypothesis tests at the population or individual level
(``test_triple()`` and ``test_individual()``, respectively).
